# aa-pbs-fixer

Firefox extension for fixing the pairing search in the
American Airlines prefential bidding system (PBS).

## Motivation

The search does a union of the facet results instead of
the intersection, which would make way more sense.

## Usage

Install the extension from the releases page and start searching.
